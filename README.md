# PyBer_analysis
## Overveiw
The goal of this project was first to get a summary of our data so we could look at how much money can be expected to be made in diffrent types of citys along with how much you can expect each ride to earn. Then we wanted to show the diffrent amounts earned by each city type over time and graph that so that we could quickly and easily see which times of the year where most profitable in each city type.

## Results
With the data collected we are able to see many trends. The most noteable one is that as the rides given by Pyber happen in more and more dense places the average cost of each ride goes down. This means that per ride Rural has the best amount of money however the denser locations also have many more rides causing the total revenue of the more dense locations to be higer. With this data we could decide if we value higer amounts of rides and focus on more Urban areas or more valuable rides and focus on Rural areas. In both cases Suburban seems to share atrabutes from Rual and Urban with more valuable rides and a higer quinty of rides, so a good middle ground. For the most part riding trneds over time seem to be pretty similar no matter which type of city you go to.

## Summary
The first recomendation i would have is to recruite a few less drives in urban areas currently there are more drivers then rides being given in Urban areas which seems inefficient. My second recomendation would be

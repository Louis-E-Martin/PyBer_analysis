# PyBer_analysis
## Overveiw
The goal of this project was first to get a summary of our data so we could look at how much money can be expected to be made in diffrent types of citys along with how much you can expect each ride to earn. Then we wanted to show the diffrent amounts earned by each city type over time and graph that so that we could quickly and easily see which times of the year where most profitable in each city type.
